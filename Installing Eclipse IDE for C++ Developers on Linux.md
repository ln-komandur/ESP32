# Installing Eclipse IDE for C++ Developers on Linux (Lubuntu 20.04.1 LTS)
## Goal:
To avoid using Arduino IDE altogether, and instead use Eclipse IDE for C++ Developers to program arduino microcontrollers, ESP32 microcontrollers 

## Pre-requisites - Key installations
Open the terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T

Update and upgrade the system with 

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

Install JRE 14 using this command if not already installed

`sudo apt install openjdk-14-jre-headless`

The following were also used to satisfy pre-requisites

```
sudo apt-get install python-is-python3
sudo apt install python3-pip

```

## Summary of all pre-requisites

The below is the summary of all pre-requisites met by the steps that follow

## Downloading and Installing Eclipse IDE for C++ Developers
Login as a User who has admin privilleges. This will be the user who will write ESP32 programs using Eclipse IDE 

Download Eclipse for CPP for Linux x86_64 from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ . On systems with default settings, the eclipse-cpp-2020-12-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz will be downloaded in the $HOME/Downloads/ directory

Extract the tar installable to the home directory of the logged in user with

`tar xvf ~/Downloads/eclipse-cpp-2020-12-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz -C ~`

Rename the eclipse directory as below to help easily distinguish from the workspace directory to be created later when starting eclipse

`mv ~/eclipse ~/eclipse-installation`

Create a symbolic link to the eclipse executable file with

`sudo ln -s ~/eclipse-installation/eclipse /usr/local/bin/`

Also test if the executable file can be called from any directory with `eclipse` at the terminal and close it.

Now, create a .desktop file to be able to start eclipse from GUI menu's in the desktop with

Create a desktop icon for Eclipse-IDE

```
echo '[Desktop Entry]
Version = 2020â€‘12
Type = Application
Terminal = false
Name = Eclipse C/C++
Exec = /usr/local/bin/eclipse
Icon = /home/the_actual_user_name/eclipse-installation/icon.xpm
Categories = Education;
' | sudo tee /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop # Create a desktop icon for Eclipse-IDE
```

Now add the current user to the 'dialout' group with

`sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`

Only the above will let this user write to the USB port to which the ESP32 (or any other microcontroller board like Arduino) will be connected for flashing

Logout and Log back in. Or restart the system with `shutdown -r now`

### Start Eclipse

1. Start eclipse after login either from the desktop menu (preferrable) or the terminal window with `eclipse`
1. Select a workspace and then go with the prompts from there

## Installing support for ESP32 within Eclipse
1. First and foremost, create a separate workspace in Eclipse for ESP32 Projects.  
1. Obtain ESP-IDF 4.0 or above from https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases using the instructions on that page
1. Install it by running `. ./install.sh` and then `. ./export.sh` . The https://medium.com/@prabhakarpanday/programming-esp32-using-esp-idf-for-tensorflow-lite-f173eec91c01 site is a good reference
1. Follow the instructions in https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md to complete the installation from within Eclipse

## Semantic errors
1. When trying examples like "Hello World", it is likely that Eclipse compiles successfully but still gives semantic errors. In that case, in the Preferences of the selected project inside Eclipse, go to C/C++ General -> Code Analysis -> Launching. Make sure that both check boxes are unchecked. Close and reopen the project or restart eclipse and rebuild the project.

1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16786555/eclipse-compiles-successfully-but-still-gives-semantic-errors/16891713

## Installing support for Arduino within Eclipse

1. First and foremost, create a separate workspace in Eclipse for Arduino Projects
1. Click "Help -> Eclipse Marketplace"
1. Find "sloeber"
1. Install "The Arduino Eclipse Plugin named Sloeber (V4)" (with the icon in a rectangular blue box)) and follow the prompts
1. After installing the plugin, go to the menu "Arduino" and click "Preferences". Under "Arduino -> Platforms and Boards" drill down to "arduino -> Arduino AVR Boards-> 1.8.3" (for Arduino Mego 2560) and apply and close

## Key points for ESP32 and Arduino support to co-exist in the same eclipse instance
1. Create exclusive workspaces in Eclipse for ESP32 Projects and Arduino Projects. This helps maintaining build configurations exclusive to each microcontroller, without stepping over onto the other's. 
1. Be mindful that these 2 microcontroller families are compiled (built) and flashed differently from within Eclipse, as also how the port names for their respective launch targets are managed.
