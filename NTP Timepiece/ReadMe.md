# NTP Timepiece

## Overview

This NTP timepiece connects to the home WiFi as soon as itâ€™s powered up and sets its in-built RTC by getting the time from an NTP server. It has no back up battery as it will always do this as soon as its power is restored.

## Next steps

The enhancement plan is as follows 
1.  as soon as it is powered up, it should first allow for set-up by
    - hosting a wifi access point by itself to which you can connect to and provide the 'set-up' information
    - taking the credentials of the wifi router to which it can connect to the internet ('set-up' information 1)
    - taking the time zone for which it to show time ('set-up' information 2)
1.  it will then connect to the internet via that router and then pick up the time from the NTP server and set itself and keep going.
